That's right! At 6:15 on Saturday Pastor Summers confirmed that there are plans to continue with Sunday service at 10:30 and Harvest Dinner at noon. The storm is settling and road crews will work through the night. 

So, we will see you there!

On November 22, 2015 we will host our yearly Harvest Dinner. We invite you for praise and fellowship plus really good food as we glorify our Lord Jesus this harvest season. This is a Thanksgiving Feast like no other.
