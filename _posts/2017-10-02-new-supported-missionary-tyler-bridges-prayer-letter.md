Tyler began as an intern at Bearing Precious Seed in 2014. It was during his internship there that the Lord made it clear to him that he should be involved in BPS Seedline. In 2014, Tyler met and began pursuing a relationship with Shannon, who had grown up traveling with her family for the Bearing Precious Seed ministry as missionaries.

In May of 2016, Tyler and Shannon both graduated from Bible college. In June of 2016, they were married. They were taken on as full time Seedline missionaries in June 2017.
