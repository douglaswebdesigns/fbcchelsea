<p>Dear Friends,</p>

<p>Another year has come and gone. We are very grateful for God’s grace and mercy throughout this year. It has definitely changed us. This year we became a family of three. We wouldn’t change it for the world. We have learned to travel with a baby and it seems we have to relearn every stage he hits. It has been fun figuring it all out.</p>

<p>Hudson is nine months this month. He is quite active. He is crawling all over the place and pulling up on anything that he can. We are afraid he will be walking soon. Then life will get interesting. He is quite a talker but we have no idea what he says except dada. He has been very healthy this year and we are very grateful for that.</p>

<p>I had my scans in December. They all came back clear, no Cancer. Praise the Lord. I will not have another scan until May of this year. We are very thankful for the continued good health that God has given our family.</p>

<p>Seedline had a very good year last year. We did millions of Scriptures in 16 languages. Now millions more will have a chance to hear the Gospel. It all couldn’t have been possible without the hard work and faithful support of churches like you. Thank you for what you mean to the ministry of Bearing Precious Seed. We are very blessed to be able to partner with you in reaching the world. Please pray that this year we will be able to do even more for the cause of Christ.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your faithfulness to our family with your continued financial support. We could not do what we do without you. Thank you for your prayers and friendship and well. You are a great encouragement to us. Looking forward to a new year serving with you for Christ.</p>

<p>Your Servants,

<p>Phil, Sarah and Hudson Taylor</p>
