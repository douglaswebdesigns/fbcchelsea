There are many topics in the Bible that are touchy and very uncomfortable to discuss and even harder to hear someone teach or preach on. The topic this week is one of those difficult topics. Many things that are so clearly addressed in the Bible and that are identified as sin by God, have become so accepted and ingrained into modern thinking and philosophy. Things that were once a black or white issue have been smudged into a shade of grey. Thankfully the Word of God has not changed. As adults, I hope we all take advantage of the opportunity this week to teach our families the truth about morality; both inside the marriage relationship, and outside of it. As parents, you will have more of an impact with your children regarding this topic (as well as every other) than I, as the pastor, ever could.
During Family School this coming Sunday we will be discussing the 7th commandment, but because of the young age of some of the children that will be present I will have to be very delicate with some of the material. Whether your children are young or old, please take time this week to take a very clear and bold stance on the subject of morality and adultery. If you will teach them the truth now, you may save them much heartache in the years ahead.
 Memorize Exodus 20:14 “Thou shalt not commit adultery.”
 The following verses are recommended reading for this week: Proverbs 6:20-35, Matthew 5:27, John 8:1-11, Galatians 5:18-25, Leviticus 20:7-10, Ezekiel 23:35-28, Matthew 19:5-6.
 In our study about adultery we will use the following definition to define adultery: The action of an individual (who is bound by the marriage covenant) being unfaithful to their spouse; whether physical (husband and wife) or spiritual (God and his people).
 It may be difficult to teach young children about the sin of adultery. For younger children it may be easier and safer to simply teach them that marriage is a man and a woman promising to only love each other and no one else for ever and ever, and, that breaking that promise is adultery. Teaching it in this way will allow them to understand the comparison that God makes between physical adultery and spiritual adultery. Another way may be to use the analogy of a man or woman dating different people. But once they find the person God wants them to marry they are no longer allowed to date other people.
 Discuss and answer the following questions:
1. According to scripture, how long does God intend for marriage to
last?
2. According to Proverbs 6:32-35, what are some things that will
happen when someone commits adultery?
3. According to Ephesians 5:22-28, what does God use the marriage
relationship to picture?
4. In Ezekiel 23:35-38, God says that his people had committed
adultery with their idols. What do you think this means?
5. Why do you think that God said not to commit adultery?
6. If marriage is a picture of God’s relationship with us (Ephesians 5),
what picture would be portrayed if someone was unfaithful to their
husband or wife?
 Using Proverbs 6:20-35 as a guide, unscramble the following words:

 Its time for another coloring contest! Make sure you have one of the
pictures of the Bride and Groom. Color it and decorate it the best you can
and then give it to Pastor Summers next week at church. We will judge
them and then let you know who wins. Make sure you write your name
somewhere on the picture.
