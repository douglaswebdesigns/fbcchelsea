Rally the Troops! God has blessed us time and again with hearts touched, decisions made, and souls saved here at Rally the Troops and we hope that you and your group can come and be a part of this year’s event! Rally the Troops aims to refocus teens and leaders on Christ right before the school year resumes, taking place labor day weekend every year, our purpose is to encourage them to be missionaries to their friends, families, and communities.</p>
