Dear Friends, 

It has been a busy few months and it will continue to be busy. Thank you so much for your prayers. I have been encouraged by those of you who tell us that they are praying as well as ask us how better to pray for us. 

In August I was able to go to the summer olympics in Brazil. I took a team of eight. There were several other groups in Rio along with us. We distributed over a hundred thousand John and Romans on the streets of Brazil. As fast as we were getting them out of the box the people were taking them. On the John and Romans there was a website they could go to get more information. We have seen people from twenty seven different countries access that site. Please continue to pray for those who have received a Bible. May the Lord keep working on their hearts. 

It has been a busy August and September. We have been on the road non stop. Completing projects in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Texas, and Florida. We are currently working on Spanish for Mexico City. We are sending a total of one million John and Romans this year to Mexico City. 

One of the biggest prayer requests for our ministry is finding missionaries and national pastors on the foreign field to send Bibles. Please pray for more opportunities to get the Word of God out. Also please pray for our men who work in the shop. They work hard to keep up with all of the orders that come in.

I will be leaving at the end of this month for Sierra Leone, Ghana and Togo. There I will present Bibles for the Sierra Leone National Police force. After preaching for their Spiritual Enrichment training, I will travel to Ghana and Togo to visit some national pastors that we have sent Bibles to in the past. Please pray for safety for this trip and that God will speak to the hearts of the policemen and women who will receive these Bibles. Thank you to all who have given and prayed to see this come to fruition. 

Hudson is doing well. He has just turned one and a half and thinks he is the center of the universe. He has been talking more and more. We are finally able to get a few intelligible words. He enjoys life to the fullest and is all over the place. We are tired but enjoying his big personality and ready smile. 

Thank you so much for all you do for us. 

Your Servants in Christ, 

Phil, Sarah and Hudson Taylor
