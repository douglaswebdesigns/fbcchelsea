The Faith Baptist Church Missions Kiosk is located right inside of the church. The information gathered using the Mission Data Submission Form will be used to help our visitors understand more about the missions we support. Children are especially curious and use the touchscreen technology to browse through prayer letters, images and video. The kiosk also offers links to the missionary website ( if available ) and a way to contact the missionary directly through email. ( email address must be provided ) Emails are monitored before sending to the appropriate missionary. Missionary prayer letters are posted on our website, all other information will be used locally and information provide through the form does not get published on the website without the permission from each missionary.</p><blockquote><h3>You can learn more about the Mission Display seen on this page and purchase for your church.
