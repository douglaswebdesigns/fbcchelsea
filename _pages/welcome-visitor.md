We are delighted to have you with us as we strive to glorify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, worshiping Him and lifting Him up as the only hope for a lost and dying world.</span> </span></p><p><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"> We preach fervently from the King James Bible and believe that it is the perfect and inerrant Word of God which serves as our final authority in all matters of faith and life.</span> </span></p><p><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"> We preach Jesus Christ and His death, burial and resurrection. He is alive today and living in the repentant believer's heart, ever interceding on our behalf before the Father.</span> </span></p><blockquote class="eye-catcher"><span style="font-size: 24pt;">We preach Jesus Christ and His death, burial and resurrection.
