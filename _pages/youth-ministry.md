<h1><span style="font-size: large;">We meet on Sunday afternoons from 1pm – 4:30pm.</span></h1>

<span style="font-size: large;">At Faith Baptist Church we realize the need for active, hands on, involvement in the outreach of the church, </span>by all ages. That is the purpose of the <strong>Surrender, Serve, Sow,</strong> (SSS) ministry. 

<span style="font-size: large;">SSS is a group of young adults between the ages of 13 and 18 that come together at least a couple times a month to focus on Surrendering themselves to the Lord (<em>Isaiah 6:8</em>), Serving others in the body of Christ (<em>Galatians 5:13</em>), and Sowing the seed of the Word of God now more than ever (<em>Psalm 126:5-6</em>).</span>

<span style="font-size: large;">The SSS, though mostly teenagers, keeps the church informed about the needs and progress of our missionaries by reading the latest prayer letter from the field, as well as being in contact with the missionaries in order to know their needs and prayer request. </span>

<span style="font-size: large;">It is through the SSS that our young men and women can thoroughly know, understand and appreciate the work and sacrifice of those that are laboring on the mission field. </span>
