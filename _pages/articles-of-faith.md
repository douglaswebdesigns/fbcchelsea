<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><em>2 Corinthians 4:13 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, </em><em>I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;</em></p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">The Trinity</span></strong></span></h2>
<p>We believe that there is One God, eternally existing in three persons: Father (Deuteronomy 33:27), Son (John 1:1), and Holy Spirit (Hebrews 9:14).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">Verbal Inspiration</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are verbally inspired by God, and inerrant in the original writings and are of supreme and final authority in faith and life (II Timothy 3:16-17).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">Virgin Birth</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe that Jesus Christ was born of the virgin Mary (Luke 1:35)</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">Total Depravity</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe that man was created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27); but he sinned, and thereby incurred, not only physical death, but also that spiritual death which is separation from God; consequently all human beings are born with a sinful and depraved nature (Psalm 51:5; Romans 3:23; Romans 5:12).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">Justification by Faith</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures<br />
 (I Corinthians 15:3) as a representative and substitutionary sacrifice; and all who believe on Him are justified on the single ground of His shed blood (Romans 3:24-25).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">Person and Work of the Holy Spirit</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the Holy Spirit is a Person who reproves the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment <a href="http://fbcchelsea.org//bible/6.htm" target="_blank">(</a>John 16: 8-11); who regenerates and baptizes all believers into the Body of Christ which is the Church (I Corinthians 12:12-13); and who indwells, enlightens, and guides the individual believer (I Corinthians 6:19; John 16:13).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">Everlasting Life</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe that all who receive the Lord Jesus Christ by the faith are born again of the Holy Spirit and thereby become children of God (John 1:12-13; Romans 8:16) and are the recipients of everlasting life (I Peter 1:3-5).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">Resurrection</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe in the resurrection of the crucified body of our Lord (Acts 2:32), in His ascension into Heaven (Acts 1:9-10), and in His present life there as High Priest and Advocate for the saved (Hebrews 4:14; I John 2:1-2).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">Second Coming of Christ</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe in the rapture of the saved to meet Him in the air (I Thessalonians 4:13-18), and in the personal, visible, imminent, and glorious return of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (Acts 1:11; Revelation 19:11-16),</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">Eschatology</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe in the bodily resurrection of the just and the unjust (John 5:28-29; I Corinthians 15:44), as well as the everlasting blessedness of the saved (Romans 6:5) and the everlasting, conscious punishment of the lost (Revelation 14:9-12; Revelation 21:8).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">Satan</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the old serpent, called the Devil and Satan is a real person who deceives the whole world (I Peter 5:8; Job 1:6-7).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">Separation from the World</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe that all Christians are called into a life of separation to the Lord and to His joyous service and from all worldly and sinful practices (I Thessalonians 1:9-10; II Corinthians 6:17-18; II Corinthians 7:1; I John 2:15-16).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">Missions</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe that all Christians are obligated to witness by word and deed to these truths and to proclaim the Gospel to all the world (Matthew 28:19-20).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">Baptism and the Lord’s Supper</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe that Christian baptism is the immersion of the believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The act is a symbol of our faith in a crucified, buried and risen Savior. The members of the church by the use of bread and fruit of the vine commemorate the Lord’s death until He comes again (Matthew 3:13-17, Matthew 26:26-27, Matthew 28:19-20; Mark 1:9-11; Luke 22:19-30; John 3:22-23; Acts 8:38-39; Romans 6:3-5; I Corinthians 10:16-17, I Corinthians 11:23-26).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">The Lord’s Day</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the first day of the week is the Lord’s Day. It is a Christian institution for regular observance. It commemorates the resurrection of Christ from the dead and should be employed in exercises of worship and spiritual devotion, both public and private, and by refraining from amusements and resting from secular employments, works of necessity and mercy only excepted (Matthew 28:1-6; John 20:1; Acts 20:7; I Corinthians 16:1-2; Revelation 1:9-11).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">The Righteous and the Wicked</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe that there is a radical and essential difference between the righteous and wicked. Only those who are justified through the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and sanctified by the Holy Spirit are truly righteous in His sight. Those who continue in impenitence and unbelief are, in His sight, wicked and under condemnation. This distinction between the righteous and the wicked holds in and after death, and will be made manifest at the judgment when final and everlasting awards are made to all men (Matthew 25:31-46; Mark 9:48; Luke 23:43; John 3:36; Romans 9:22-24; I Corinthians 15:45-53; II Corinthians 5:1-10; Philippians 3:20-21; I Thessalonians 4:16-17; Revelation 20:10-15).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">Religious Liberty</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe that God alone is Lord of the conscience and He has left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men which are contrary to or not contained in His Word. Church and State should be separate. The state owes to the church protection and full freedom in the pursuit of its spiritual ends. In providing for such freedom, no ecclesiastical group or denomination should be favored by the state more than others. Civil government being ordained of God, it is the duty of Christians to render loyal obedience thereto in all things not contrary to the revealed will of God. The church should not resort to the civil power to carry on its work. The Gospel of Christ contemplates spiritual means alone for the pursuit of its ends. The state has no right to impose penalties for religious opinions of any kind. The state has no right to impose taxes for the support of any form of religion. A free church in a free state is the Christian ideal, and this implies the right of free and unhindered access to God on the part of all men, and the right to form and propagate opinions in the sphere of religion without interference by the civil power (Matthew 22:17-21; Romans 13:1-7; I Timothy 2:14; I Peter 2:17).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">Social Service</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe that every Christian is under obligation to seek to make the will of Christ of greatest importance in his own life and in human society; to oppose in the spirit of Christ every form of greed, selfishness, and vice; to provide for the orphaned, the aged, the helpless, and the sick; to seek to bring industry, government, and society as a whole under the sway of the principles of righteousness, truth and brotherly love. To promote these ends Christians should be ready to work with all men of good will in any good cause, always being careful to act in the spirit of love without compromising their loyalty to Christ and His truth. All means and methods used in social service for the betterment of society and the establishment of righteousness among men must finally depend on the regeneration of the individual by the saving grace of God in Christ Jesus (Exodus 20:16; Exodus 22:9-15; Leviticus 6:1-5; Deuteronomy 4:41-42, Deuteronomy 15:1-2, Deuteronomy 27:17; Ezekiel 18:5-9; Zechariah 8:16-17; Luke 6:27-36, Luke 10:25-37; Romans 12:14-21; Colossians 3:12-17; James 2:8).</p>
<h2> <strong><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style';">Evangelism and Missions</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe that it is the duty of every Christian and every church of Christ to seek to extend the gospel to the ends of the earth. The new birth of man’s spirit by God’s Holy Spirit means the birth of love for others. Missionary effort on the part of all rests thus upon a spiritual necessity of the regenerate life and is also expressly and repeatedly commanded in the teachings of Christ. It is the duty of every child of God to seek constantly to win the lost to Christ by personal effort and by all other methods sanctioned by the gospel of Christ (Matthew 10:5-15, Matthew 13:1-23, Matthew 22:8-10, Matthew 28:19-20; Mark 16: 15-16, Mark 16:19-20; Luke 24:46-53; Acts 1:4-8, Acts 2:1-4, Acts 8:1-40, Acts 10:42-48, Acts 13:1-3, Acts 21:39; II Corinthians 5:19-21).</p>
